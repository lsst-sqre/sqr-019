    "# LSST Verification Framework Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "`lsst.verify` is the new framework for making verification measurements in the LSST Science Pipelines. *Verification* is an activity where well-defined quantities, called *metrics*, are measured to ensure that LSST's data and pipelines meet requirements, which we call *specifications*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be familar with `validate_drp`. That package that currently measures metrics of `ProcessCcdTask` outputs and posts results to [SQUASH](https://squash.lsst.codes). By tracking metric measurements we are able to understand trends in the algorithmic performance of the LSST Science Pipelines, and ultimately verify that we will meet our requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `lsst.verify` we sought to generalize the process of defining metrics, measuring those metrics, and tracking those measurements in SQUASH. Rather than supporting only specially-design verification afterburner tasks, our goal is to empower developers to track performance metrics of their own specific pipeline Tasks. By defining metrics relevant to specific Tasks, verification becomes a highly relevant integration testing activity for day-to-day pipelines development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates key features and patterns in the `lsst.verify` framework, from defining metrics and specifications, to making measurements, to analyzing and summarizing performance."

    "## Defining metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics are definitions of measurable things that you want to track. A measureable thing could be anything: the $\\chi^2$ of a fit, the number of sources identified and measured, or even the latency or memory usage of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the verification framework, all metrics are centrally defined in the [verify_metrics](https://github.com/lsst/verify_metrics) package. To define a new metric, simply add or modify a YAML file in the `/metrics` directory of [verify_metrics](https://github.com/lsst/verify_metrics). Each Stack package that measures metrics has its own YAML definitions file (`jointcal.yaml`, `validate_drp.yaml`, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQUASH watches `verify_metrics` so that when a metric is committed to the GitHub repo is it also known to the SQUASH dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will create metrics for hypothetical `demo1` and `demo2` packages. Here are some metric definitions."
