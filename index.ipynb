    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`lsst.verify` is the new framework for making verification measurements in the LSST Science Pipelines. *Verification* is an activity where well-defined quantities, called *metrics*, are measured to ensure that LSST's data and pipelines meet requirements, which we call *specifications*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be familar with `validate_drp`. That package that currently measures metrics of `ProcessCcdTask` outputs and posts results to [SQUASH](https://squash.lsst.codes). By tracking metric measurements we are able to understand trends in the algorithmic performance of the LSST Science Pipelines, and ultimately verify that we will meet our requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `lsst.verify` we sought to generalize the process of defining metrics, measuring those metrics, and tracking those measurements in SQUASH. Rather than supporting only specially-design verification afterburner tasks, our goal is to empower developers to track performance metrics of their own specific pipeline Tasks. By defining metrics relevant to specific Tasks, verification becomes a highly relevant integration testing activity for day-to-day pipelines development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates key features and patterns in the `lsst.verify` framework, from defining metrics and specifications, to making measurements, to analyzing and summarizing performance."

    "## Defining metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics are definitions of measurable things that you want to track. A measureable thing could be anything: the $\\chi^2$ of a fit, the number of sources identified and measured, or even the latency or memory usage of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the verification framework, all metrics are centrally defined in the [verify_metrics](https://github.com/lsst/verify_metrics) package. To define a new metric, simply add or modify a YAML file in the `/metrics` directory of [verify_metrics](https://github.com/lsst/verify_metrics). Each Stack package that measures metrics has its own YAML definitions file (`jointcal.yaml`, `validate_drp.yaml`, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQUASH watches `verify_metrics` so that when a metric is committed to the GitHub repo is it also known to the SQUASH dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will create metrics for hypothetical `demo1` and `demo2` packages. Here are some metric definitions."

    "\n",
    "Often you'll make measurements of a metric in many contexts. With different datasets, from different cameras, in different filters. A specification we define for one measurement context might not be relevant for other contexts. LPM-17, for example, does this frequently by defining different specifications for $gri$ datasets than $uzy$. To prevent false alerts, the Verification Framework allows you to define criteria for when a specification applies to a measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally we indended to leverage the *provenance* of a pipeline execution. Provenance, in general, fully describes the environment of the pipeline run, the datasets that were processed and produced, and the pipeline configuration. We envisioned that specifications might query the provenance of a metric measurement to determine if the specification's test is applicable. While this is our long term design intent, a comprehensive pipeline provenance framework does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "To shim the provenance system's functionality, the Verification Framework introduces a complementary concept called *job metadata*. Whereas provenance is passively gathered during pipeline execution, metadata is explicitly added by pipeline developers and operators. Metadata could be a task configuration, filter name, dataset name, or any state known during a Task's execution.\n",
